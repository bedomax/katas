# Daily Coding Katas Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Daily Coding Katas Repository! This repository is dedicated to the daily practice of coding challenges, known as katas. Each day, a new kata is solved and stored here, allowing for consistent practice and improvement of programming skills.

## Structure

The repository is organized by date, with each day's kata stored in its respective folder. The structure is as follows:

/katas
/YYYY-MM-DD
- kata_description.md (or .txt)
- solution_file.extension
- test_file.extension

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you'd like to share your own solutions or suggest improvements to existing ones, feel free to create a pull request.

## Usage

To work on a kata:

1. **Select a Kata**: Choose a coding challenge from your preferred platform or source.
2. **Solve the Kata**: Write your solution in a programming language of your choice.
3. **Test Your Solution**: Write tests to validate your solution, ensuring it meets the kata's requirements.
4. **Store Your Solution**: Create a new folder with the date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) under the `/katas` directory. Include your solution file, test file, and a brief description of the kata.
5. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes with a descriptive message and push them to the repository.

## Daily Practice

Consistency is key to improvement. Try to solve at least one kata every day and push your solution to this repository. Over time, you'll be able to track your progress and see how your skills develop.
