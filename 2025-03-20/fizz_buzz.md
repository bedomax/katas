# ðŸ¥‹ FizzBuzz Kata in Ruby

This is a simple implementation of the classic FizzBuzz kata in Ruby.

## ðŸ§  Problem Description

Write a method `fizzbuzz(max)` that returns the numbers from 1 to `max`, following these rules:

- If the number is divisible by 3, return `"Fizz"` instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by 5, return `"Buzz"` instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, return `"FizzBuzz"`.
- Otherwise, return the number as a string.
